# 📧 Email/SMS Spam Classifier (Streamlit + ML)

A Streamlit-based Machine Learning web application that classifies messages as:

- 🚨 Spam  
- ✅ Not Spam  

The system uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and a trained Machine Learning model to detect spam messages.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a text classification system for detecting spam emails or SMS messages.

The workflow:

1. Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
2. TF-IDF vectorization
3. Machine Learning model prediction
4. Real-time result display using Streamlit
